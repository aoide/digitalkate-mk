# Kudos

## Synthetic Internet Training Environment (SITE) @ IDS

> The Synthetic Internet Training Environment (SITE) was an enormous part of BR22. It provides a "click-able, interactive" internet that dynamically replicates various websites and social media sites to allow Cyber, Information Warfare, and PAO and OSINT interaction/play for the training audience.

*JSOC Commander (LTG Fenton) to the USSOCOM Commander (GEN Clark) in an update on BR22 (Bronze Ram 22)*

> Kate has provided indispensable guidance and direction through her dogged research to pin down, design, and often implement the requirements for myriad additions and changes to the Exercise Development and Management Tool (EDMT.) She is an invaluable member of the team and contributes in ways that go far beyond her job description. We couldn't do it without her!

*Allison Sorce, Technical Director*

> Kate has been instrumental in overall EDMT maturity from day one. Her ideas and approach to UX have simplified and enhanced EDMT. I cannot wait to see all her work implemented!

*Matt Ehlers, Vice President Operations*

> Kate is everywhere. She's a UX designer turned Ninja! Make the UI glimmer: check. Lend a hand in QA: check. Need someone to be the Kibana reporting wizard: check. Need someone to augment the documentation effort: check. The dev team is delighted to have such a willing, capable, and adaptable person having everyone's back in just about any way we can imagine. ...and it all comes with a smile.

*Jonathan Nocjar, Vice President Product Development*

> Kate has done an exceptional job ensuring SMEIR and our EDMT look and feel like a full developed system. Kate's designs and sleek, current, and incredibly user friendly. Matt Ehlers was showing us the new analytics functionality and my first thought was "wow, this looks as sophisticated as Google Analytics."

## Technical Publications @ Boeing</h3>

> Excellent job in the CAE meeting, you were well prepared. That is exactly the type of conversation we want to have with our customers!

*Dave, Customer Liaison*

> Kate, we will miss you, you have been an outstanding teammate and contributor.  Our products are definitely much improved, thanks to your hard work and your dedication to providing high-quality implementations and specifications.

*Dan Snook, Software Engineer*

## Joint Ordnance Explosive Disposal Applications @ Boeing</h3>

> Kate received praise from the client about her diligent, efficient, and spot-on work. She also served as liaison to the four Service detachments displaying system changes through her designs. Kate exhibited great service to the client and to her peers. Kate continually delivered her high quality work on time, or in some cases, early.  She is a bright shining star for the DSS team and a model employee deserving of individual recognition.

*Jack Moffett, UX Lead/Manager @ Employee of the Quarter Nomination & Subsequent Win*

> She really has been awesome. She has had to deal with a lot of changes, updates, running around for me and she did a great job briefing the detachments.

*Kent Eldredge, Government Customer*
