# Designer. Coder. Geek.

Hi! I'm Kate.

I'm a full stack designer specializing in enterprise applications. I've been working with people to ship software for over 10 years.

## What does this mean for you?

I'm used to wearing multiple hats to get a job done.

I talk to users, write requirements, drive user flows, talk to users more, craft wire frames, create behavior specifications, more user conversations, and prototype everything.

I also implement front end interfaces using React, Angular, JQuery, HTML, and CSS/SCSS.

## As for the rest…

I'm owned by 2 cats, and I read... a lot. I love gaming and farmer's markets… and drinking chai. Lots of chai.
