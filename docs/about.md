# Designer. Coder. Geek.

Hi! I'm Kate.

I'm a full stack designer specializing in enterprise applications. I've been working with people to ship software for over 10 years.

## What does this mean for you?</h3>

I'm used to wearing multiple hats to get a job done.

I talk to users, write requirements, drive user flows, talk to users more, craft wireframes, create behavior specifications, more user conversations, and prototype everything.

 also implement front end interfaces using React, Angular, JQuery, HTML, and CSS/SCSS.

## As for the rest…

I'm owned by 2 cats, and I read... a lot. I love gaming and farmer's markets… and drinking chai. Lots of chai.
